This package is a collection of Vim scripts designed to make editing
Rails applications an absolute doddle.

The primary focus is the excellent 'rails.vim' script written by Tim
pope, plus a couple other supporting scripts (allml.vim, surround.vim)
also by Tim.

Added to these are 'project.vim' and 'dbext.vim' which provide a file
explorer and direct database access respectively.

I've also included the haml syntax file.
